// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number divided by 2 is an integer = Even
if number divided by 2 is not an integer = odd

num1 = 2
num2 = 5

num1/2 = 1
num2/2 = 2.5

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) num1 = 1, num2 = 2, num3 = 3, num4 = 4, num5 = 5
print num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

b) add numbers 1 through 5 (1+2+3+4+5)
sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 
print sum

c) find min of (num1 ... num5)
   find max of (num1 ... num5)

d) Sum of the 5 numbers is 15: (1+2+3+4+5) = 15; the lowest number is 1 and highest number is 5
